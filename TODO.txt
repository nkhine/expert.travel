1) Import of abakuc_import_companies.csv

The abakuc_import_companies.csv is the entire http://uktravellist.info database
with each Company full postal address and related to the actual topic.

It consists of the following fields:

"topic_id";"topic_name";"region";"county";"post_town";"company_name";"address";"telephone";"fax_number";"email";"url";"licences";"logo URL"

Please note:

a) address - currently the address filed is all in one field - if possible, I
would like to strip out the Post Code field out and remove the Region. For
example

The first record in the csv has an address filed, as:

Beauport House
L'Avenue de la Commune
St. Peter
Jersey
JE3 7BY
Channel Islands


where the last 3 rows are:

post_town
post_code
county

this is true for most addresse, where there are exceptions, I would manually
change them when the addresses have been loaded.

b) email - as the email is used to generate the ownership of the company, in
cases where there is no email, please make the enquiries@uktravellist.info the
owner of these. Or maybe there is a better way, as I am not sure a user can
belong to more then one company? If not then perhaps we can leave these without
users and the first user who attaches themselves to the company will become the
'owner' of it.

c) the structural navigation of the site:

topic_name
+region
++county
+++post_town
